Change: display and delete invalid background jobs

Background jobs can be no longer valid because they are from an old version of
an app, or from an app that has been disabled. These jobs can now be listed
with the command:

occ background:queue:status --display-invalid-jobs

And can be deleted with the command:

occ background:queue:delete <Job ID>
